* Overview
This repository contains the Org source files for the white paper.

* Build
** Vix
To generate the PDF from Org using make inside a development shell, run the following command:
#+begin_src
vix m
#+end_src
To remove all build files, use:
#+begin_src
vix m cleanall
#+end_src

** Without Vix
To build the PDF using an alternative method without using flake, execute:
#+begin_src
make
#+end_src
To clean up the build, run:
#+begin_src
make cleanall
#+end_src
This process has already been automated to handle both cleanups and PDF generation from Org using LaTeX.
