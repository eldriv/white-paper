#+TITLE: white-paper
* Overview
This repository contains the Org sources for the white paper.

* Exporting
To export the Org file to PDF, run:

=M-x org-pandoc-export-as-latex RET=

To export the Org file to HTML, run:

=M-x org-pandoc-export-as-html5 RET=

* Final TeX file cleanups

To make it possible to build a correct PDF file without errors from a command line, a few cleanups
need to be applied to the generated ~white-paper.tex~ file:

Delete the redundant reference to the bibliography, e.g.:

=\addbibresource{/Users/ebzzry/Documents/white-paper/references.bib}=

Edit the ~pdfcreator~ property to remove invalid syntax:

e.g., before:

=pdfauthor={Rommel Martínez \url{mailto:ebzzry@icloud.com} \\\medskip \url{https://ebzzry.com}},=

after:

=pdfauthor={Rommel Martínez},=

Edit the ~abstract~ section, down-casing the ~ABSTRACT~ word:

e.g., before:

=\begin{ABSTRACT}=
=\end{ABSTRACT}=

after:

=\begin{abstract}=
=\end{abstract}=

*TODO:* This process should be automated via scripting
